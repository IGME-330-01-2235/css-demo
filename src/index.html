    <h2>css-04 : Normal Flow</h2>
    <p>This branch demonstrates the Normal Flow of an HTML/CSS document.</p>
    <p>It adds 40px of padding on the &lt;html&gt; element.</p>
    <p>See how block-level elements like &lt;h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt;, and &lt;p&gt; take up 100% of the width afforded to them? They also are rendered top-to-bottom, being provided with as much height as their content needs, and wrap wne necessary.</p>
    <p>Block elements can have margin (spacing outside, between the border and neighboring elements) and padding (spacing inside, between the border and the content).</p>
    <p>Inline elements (like this <strong>strong</strong>) can have left/right margin and padding, but no top/bottom margin (only padding, and even then, it doesn't affect neighbors).</p>
    <p>Understanding how the CSS Box Model (margin, border, padding, content) and Normal Flow work, and building your page to take advantage of what it wants to do normally, is what I mean when I say "Stop Fighting CSS!"</p>
